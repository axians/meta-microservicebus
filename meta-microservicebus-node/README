I. Adding the meta-microservicebus-node layer to your build
===========================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to clone the repository of meta-openembedded, 
meta-microservicebus and then make the build system aware of it. Add the layers
manually to bblayers.conf or use add-layer.

In following example the layers and build directory is located in pokys top directory 
and the current directory are the sourced build directory.

Run the following to add layers to bblayers.conf:

  bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-oe
  bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-microservicebus/meta-microservicebus-node

II. Add microservicebus-node to your target
===========================================

To only add microservicebus-node agent to your target add the "microservicebus-node"
package to your local.conf or image recipe file:

  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " microservicebus-node"

This will install microservicebus-node in /usr/lib/node/ on your target and microservicebus-node-user
to setup an system user to run microservicebus-node under. For configuration look at section VII below.

III. Add systemd service configuration for microservicebus-node
===============================================================

In order to run microservicebus-node agent as an service an systemd recipe is
included as an reference, the systemd configuration may need alteration for your target.
The systemd service file is located under recipes-microservicebus-node/microservicebus-node-service/files.
To add systemd service to your target add the "microservicebus-node-service"
package to your local.conf or image recipe file:

  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " microservicebus-node-service"

IV. Add nodejs serialport support
=================================

On some constrained device where the support for building npm packages on the target is not supported
the alternetive is to let bitbake build it, serialport is often used by microservicebus-node
services and is therfore supplied in the layer for conviniens. It will be installed as an
global npm package in /usr/lib/node/.
To add serialport to your target add the "nodejs-serialport" package to your local.conf 
or image recipe file:

  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " nodejs-serialport"

V. Add nodejs dbus support
==========================

On some constrained device where the support for building npm packages on the target is not supported
the alternetive is to let bitbake build it, dbus is used by microservicebus-core to supply an dbus API.
It will be installed as an global npm package in /usr/lib/node/.
To add nodejs-dbus to your target add the "nodejs-dbus" package to your local.conf 
or image recipe file:

  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " nodejs-dbus"

VI. Using package group to simplify installation of microservicebus related packages
=====================================================================================

meta-microservicebus-node is supplied with some package groups loclated in 
./recipes-microservicebus-node/packagegroups:

  - packagegroup-microservicebus-base

    Adds all recomended packages to get microservicebus up and running.

  - packagegroup-microservicebus-extra

    Adds nice to have packages like nodejs-serialport.

  - packagegroup-microservicebus-build

    Adds all packages related to build npm packages using gyp on target,
    this includes make, gcc, binutils.

VII. Configuration variables to adapt installations to target
==============================================================

In most of the recipes supplied in meta-microservicebus week assignments to variables is
used to allow customization of the build. Below is an list of variables grouped under respectice
recipe. The default settings shuld be good to get you up and running.

  - microservicebus-node-user

    MSB_NODE_USER ?= "msb"            # Name of user for microServicebus
    MSB_NODE_GROUP ?= "msb"           # Name of user group for microServicebus
    MSB_HOME_DIR_PATH ?= ""           # Specify home directory for msb user, default empty meaning it will be set to default for useradd
    MSB_USER_GROUPS ?= "tty,dialout"  # Specify users groups
    MSB_USER_UID ?= "350"             # Specify users uid

  - microservicebus-node-service

    MSB_NODE_ARG ?= "-w"              # Argument to microservicebus-node, default "-w" is to login using MAC and whitelist
    MSB_NODE_WORK_DIR ?= "/usr/lib/node/microservicebus-node"   # Workdir is default to npm default installation dir
    MSB_NODE_USER ?= "root"           # Name of user for microServicebus
    MSB_NODE_GROUP ?= "root"          # Name of user group for microServicebus
    MSB_NODE_HOST ?= "microservicebus.com"  # If using private hosting nd custom domain this need to change
