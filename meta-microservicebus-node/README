I. Adding the meta-microservicebus-node layer to your build
===========================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to clone the repository of meta-openembedded, 
meta-microservicebus and then make the build system aware of it. Add the layers
manually to bblayers.conf or use add-layer.

In following example the layers and build directory is located in pokys top directory 
and the current directory are the sourced build directory.

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-microservicebus/meta-microservicebus-node' 
to add layer to bblayers.conf

II. Add microservicebus-node to your target
===========================================

To only add microservicebus-node agent to your target add the "microservicebus-node"
package to your local.conf or image recipe file:

  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " microservicebus-node"

This will install microservicebus-node in /usr/lib/node_modules/ on your target.

III. Add systemd service configuration for microservicebus-node
===============================================================

In order to run microservicebus-node agent as an service an systemd recipe is
included as an reference, systemd configurations may need alteration for your target.
The systemd service file is located under recipes-microservicebus-node/microservicebus-node-service/files

  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " microservicebus-node-service"

IV. Add nodejs serialport support
=================================

On some constrained device where the support for building npm packages on the target is not supported
the alternetive is to let bitbake build it, serialport is often used by microservicebus-node
services and is therfore supplied in the layer for conviniens. It will be installed as an
global npm package in /usr/lib/node_modules/.

  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " nodejs-serialport"

V. Using package group to add support for building npm packages using gyp on target
===================================================================================

An package group is supplied to add all packaged for microservicebus-node + packages related
to build npm packages using gyp on target, this includes make, gcc, binutils. To install the
package group add the following to your local.conf or image recipe file:

  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " packagegroup-microservicebus"
