I. Adding the meta-microservicebus-node layer to your build
===========================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to clone the repository of meta-openembedded, 
meta-microservicebus and then make the build system aware of it. Add the layers
manually to bblayers.conf or use add-layer.

In following example the layers and build directory is located in pokys top directory 
and the current directory are the sourced build directory.

Run the following to add layers to bblayers.conf:

  bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-openembedded/meta-oe
  bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-microservicebus/meta-microservicebus-node

II. Add microservicebus-node to your target
===========================================

To only add microservicebus-node agent to your target add the "microservicebus-node"
package to your local.conf or image recipe file:

  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " microservicebus-node"

This will install microservicebus-node in /usr/lib/node/ on your target and microservicebus-node-user
to setup a system user to run microservicebus-node under. For configuration look at section VII below.

III. Add systemd service configuration for microservicebus-node
===============================================================

In order to run microservicebus-node agent as a service a systemd recipe is
included as an reference, the systemd configuration may need alteration for your target.
The systemd service file is located under recipes-microservicebus-node/microservicebus-node-service/files.
To add systemd service to your target add the "microservicebus-node-service"
package to your local.conf or image recipe file:

  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " microservicebus-node-service"

IV. Add nodejs dbus support
==========================

On some constrained device where the support for building npm packages on the target is not supported
the alternative is to let bitbake build it, dbus is used by microservicebus-core to supply an dbus API.
It will be installed as a global npm package in /usr/lib/node/.
To add nodejs-dbus to your target add the "nodejs-dbus" package to your local.conf 
or image recipe file:

  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " nodejs-dbus"

V. Using package groups
========================

To simplify installation of microservicebus related packages on target
meta-microservicebus-node is supplied with some package groups located in 
./recipes-microservicebus-node/packagegroups:

  - packagegroup-microservicebus-base

    Adds all recomended packages to get microservicebus up and running.

  - packagegroup-microservicebus-extra

    Adds nice to have packages.

  - packagegroup-microservicebus-build

    Adds all packages related to build npm packages using gyp on target,
    this includes make, gcc, binutils.

VI. Configuration variables to adapt installations to target
==============================================================

In most of the recipes supplied in meta-microservicebus weak assignments to variables is
used to allow customization of the build. Below is a list of variables grouped under respective
recipe. The default settings should be good to get you up and running.

  - microservicebus-node-user

    MSB_NODE_USER ?= "msb"            # Name of user for microServicebus
    MSB_NODE_GROUP ?= "msb"           # Name of user group for microServicebus
    MSB_HOME_DIR_PATH ?= ""           # Specify home directory for msb user, default empty meaning it will be set to default for useradd
    MSB_USER_GROUPS ?= "tty,dialout"  # Specify users groups
    MSB_USER_UID ?= "350"             # Specify users uid

  - microservicebus-node-service

    MSB_NODE_ARG ?= "-w"              # Argument to microservicebus-node, default "-w" is to login using MAC and white list
    MSB_NODE_WORK_DIR ?= "/usr/lib/node/microservicebus-node"   # Workdir is default to npm default installation dir
    MSB_NODE_USER ?= "root"           # Name of user for microServicebus
    MSB_NODE_GROUP ?= "root"          # Name of user group for microServicebus
    MSB_NODE_HOST ?= "microservicebus.com"  # If using private hosting and custom domain this need to change
